The final project of the Odin foundations course. 
HTML, CSS and mainly JS.

Obviously towards the end, I got tired and wrote a bunch of unnecessary lines, created a mess in the code structure, and added a lot of branching. 
But at least, it seems to work as I intended.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to use Objects. Obviously I don't understand when to use them.
